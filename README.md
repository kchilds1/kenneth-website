## TABS

## PAGES
* Home page should have a button to take guest to my resume and say hello, welcome to my page and have my title as a web developer on it.

* About page should have a summary of who I am. Might be good to add the summary from my resume onto this page. I can also talk about my hobbies. Example being a drone pilot and maybe add a photo or two of what I did as a drone pilot.

* Skills page should have the icons of all the Technologies I've used in bootcamp. I could get this from my github about page. I can also talk about html, css, js, react, mongodb, and the different libraries I've used.

* contact page should have my phone number, email, github, social media, call to action(reach out to me), or a way for recruiters to leave their contact information on my site.

* Projects page should have a button in case guess would like to see my code and a button for guest to see the deployment.  I should have an image as a preview of what the deployment looks like. I should also have the title, features and what Tech Stack(libraries, languages, database used) I used.
